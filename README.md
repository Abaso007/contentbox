# ContentBox

The organized solution for Content Creators.

## Core idea

If you are an active content creator, you probably have many pieces of content. 

The problem is that you have to manage them in different places, and keeping track of them is hard. 

ContentBox is a solution to this problem. It's a place where you can store all your content, and it's easy to manage.

You can add content from different sources and search for them easily (search will be integrated with Algolia).
